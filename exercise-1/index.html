	<h1>Exercise 1</h1>
	<p>
		Create an HTML page that will allow you to "alert" the date and time the page
		is loaded three times.  At the top of the HTML page, insert any paragraph
		of copy.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first alert should come from an external file in your project that is
		included in the <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> portion of your file.  The second alert should
		be triggered by an inline script tag at the bottom of your HTML page.  For the third
		alert, you won't include anything in the page, just trigger the alert
		via Firebug.
	</p>
	<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
		var current_date = new Date();
		alert("From the Script Tag: " + current_date);
	</script>
